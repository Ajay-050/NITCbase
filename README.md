## Introduction

This project is a character device driver for Linux that accepts two parameters: `kernel_version` and `time`. The driver is designed to be inserted into the kernel only if the given kernel version matches the version during module compilation. If the insertion is successful, it prints the major number, minor number, and the timer value.

## Requirements

- Linux development environment
- Kernel headers for the target kernel version

## Setup

1. Ensure that you have the correct kernel headers installed for your target kernel version.

2. ...

## Building the Module

To build the module, follow these steps:

1. ...

## Loading the Module

To load the module into the kernel, use the following command:

```bash
sudo insmod your_module.ko kernel_version=<target_version> time=<specified_time>
